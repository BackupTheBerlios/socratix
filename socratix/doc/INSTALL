Socratix Installation
=====================

First, download the Socratix tarball and extract it. Now change into
the generated directory. There type "make" to compile the source files.
Put an 1.44meg disk into /dev/fd0 (A:), all data on this disk
will be lost!!! Type "make install" to write the Socratix bootdisk to
/dev/fd0. 
Now you have a bootable Socratix disk. Restart your computer, change the
boot order in the bios to look first at drive a: and put the Socratix
disk into this drive. Now Socratix should start.

Please report bugs to us on the Socratix homepage. Thanks.
